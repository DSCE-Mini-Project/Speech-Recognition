We pick up with young Sylvie in her version of Asgard and can catch her playing with toys. Amongst these she mentions a dragon which of course appeared at the start of Thor Ragnarok. This is beaten by a Valykrie which of course appeared in that movie too and interestingly we can catch a giant wolf toy next to a ship which I believe is Fenris.\n\nThe TVA arrive and escort her away on the authority of the Time Keepers and it shows how evil that the organisation really is. Sylvie is just a child and the fact they're wiping her out just for existing is pretty bad.\n\nShe's taken through the procedures that the older version of Loki was even down to the same room. As we pointed out in our first breakdown this place contained an image of Stan Lee amongst the time keeper murals.\n\nSylvie stole the temppad from Revanno Renslayer as a child when she was one of the minutemen and since then she's been on the run. Cut to the present and we watch as Ravanno takes the golden elevator to the Timekeepers who sit on their thrones.\n\nAs we know Renslayer is the only one who is allowed to speak with them and it's very ominous seeing them cloaked in darkness and smoke. If this was a Disney show which it is...then yeah...no points for guessing these are the bad guys.\n\nCut to the title screen which we see fading in, incase you missed our last video we went over how this is actually an effect caused when you photocopy something repeatedly. Known as generation loss eventually the quality diminishes and Loki himself even referred to Sylvie as a photocopy last week.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time."

This was the eighth launch and landing of this Falcon 9 first stage booster in exactly one year, which previously supported launch of GPS III Space Vehicle 03, Turksat 5A, and five Starlink missions.

But today Carder, Lizzy Capri, Deniesse and magician Andrew Wafellow (@Wafellow) (or is it Ryan Prunty??) compete in the Invisible Camouflage Hide and Seek challenge!! We got professional body painters ArtByMiho to paint Lizzy, Denice and Andrew to see if they could hide from Matthew Braeden for $10,000!! Matt used a very clever strategy that some might call cheating by calling Lizzy's phone while she was hiding, which finally exposed her blending in with a wall of pool noodles. Denise hid in a ball pit and was painted so well that we had trouble spotting her while looking directly at her and Andrew blended directly into our Team RAR merch. Did he save the day or did Matt win the $10,000?? Where would you hide?? Do you think you could have spotted Lizzy, Deniesse and Andrew?? Comment below!!\n\nSpecial thanks to Miho, Karina and Judith for their amazing body painting in this video!! https://www.instagram.com/artbymiho\n\n❇️ MORE EPIC VLOGS ❇️\n@Ben Azelart Using only ONE Color in HIDE AND SEEK!

But today Carder, Lizzy Capri, Deniesse and magician Andrew Wafellow (@Wafellow) (or is it Ryan Prunty??) compete in the Invisible Camouflage Hide and Seek challenge!! We got professional body painters ArtByMiho to paint Lizzy, Denice and Andrew to see if they could hide from Matthew Braeden for $10,000!! Matt used a very clever strategy that some might call cheating by calling Lizzy's phone while she was hiding, which finally exposed her blending in with a wall of pool noodles. Denise hid in a ball pit and was painted so well that we had trouble spotting her while looking directly at her and Andrew blended directly into our Team RAR merch. Did he save the day or did Matt win the $10,000?? Where would you hide?? Do you think you could have spotted Lizzy, Deniesse and Andrew??
